This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of customer retention patterns at Premier Auto Repair Shop, using data from over 150 customer interactions recorded over the past year. By examining these interactions, the report aims to identify key factors that drive customer satisfaction and loyalty, providing actionable insights to improve the shop's services and operational efficiency.

Project Objectives:
1. Analyze Customer Retention: Understand the behavior of returning customers versus first-time clients, with a focus on frequency, service preferences, and spending habits.
2. Identify Satisfaction Drivers: Pinpoint the most significant factors influencing customer satisfaction, including service quality, pricing, and time efficiency.
3. Assess Service Performance: Evaluate the performance of various service categories, identifying areas where improvements could enhance customer loyalty.
4. Optimize Operations: Provide data-driven recommendations for operational changes that could increase repeat business and long-term customer retention.

Data Insights:
The analysis is built upon detailed customer interaction data, including demographic information, service types requested, feedback ratings, and follow-up actions. These insights were distilled into actionable metrics using Excel for data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis. PowerPoint was utilized for presenting findings in an intuitive, stakeholder-friendly format.

Methodology:
- Data Collection: Historical customer interaction data was sourced from the repair shop’s CRM, including feedback forms and service reports.
- Data Analysis: The dataset was cleaned, structured, and analyzed entirely in Excel. Key metrics such as customer return rate, average time between visits, and satisfaction scores were computed using Excel’s functions and data analysis tools.
- Visualization: Charts and graphs were created in Excel to visually represent trends, and these were integrated into PowerPoint slides for presentation.

Key Findings:
- Customer Satisfaction: Quick turnaround times and personalized services emerged as strong predictors of customer satisfaction.
- Loyalty Drivers: The analysis revealed that customers who received timely follow-up services and loyalty perks (discounts, referral programs) were more likely to return.
- Service Categories: Mechanical services showed the highest retention rate, while bodywork and cosmetic repairs had a lower return rate.

Recommendations:
Based on the findings, the project suggests several strategies for improving customer retention, including introducing loyalty programs, streamlining operations to reduce service time, and enhancing customer communication through personalized follow-ups.
Tools Used:
